# Bootstrap Framework

The Bootstrap framework is a popular open-source front-end development framework. It provides a collection of pre-designed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components that users may use to quickly build responsive and visually appealing web applications.
With Bootstrap, developers can easily create responsive websites that adapt seamlessly to different screen resolutions, from mobile phones to desktop computers. It also includes a wide range of UI components like buttons, navigation bars, modals, and forms, making it simple to create consistent and user-friendly interfaces. 

I prefer to use Bootstrap because I've been taught about it in class, and I'm more comfortable with it. For example, in the demo HTML provided, i have created a navigation bar and a carousel banner. It's easy to select the desired elements and quickly copy and paste the code, allowing for easy adjustments.
